    <h3>IRON MAN</h3>
<P> 
    Iron man is not a man born with super power he have used his intelligence in a correct way when the time came he stood up fought for his motto and achieved it but <i>never stopped exploring new things</i> and <b>never stopped upgrading himself</b> with the time.
    <br>
    The same thing that i tried inheriting from that character was <b><i>Patience and resilliance</i></b>
